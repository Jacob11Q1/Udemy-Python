# Python Variables:

# name = input("What Is Your Name?")
# print(name) # Output: The Name You Enter

# Onother Example:
firstName = "Jacob"
lastName = "Qumsiyeh"
print("My Name Is:",firstName,lastName) # Output: My Name Is: Jacob Qumsiyeh

# To Get The Length Of Any String We Use The Method Below
print(len(firstName)) # Output: 5
print(len(lastName)) # Output: 8

# Onother Example:
name = "Jack"
print(name) # Output: Jack
name = "Angela"
print(name) # Output: Angela
print(len(name)) # Output: 6 Because it took the last print function


# Exercise:
firstName = "Jacob"
lastName = " Qumsiyeh"
fullName = firstName + lastName
print(fullName) # Output: Jacob Qumsiyeh
print(len(fullName)) # Output: 14 Because of the space between them

# Onother Version Of The Same Exersice:
firstName = "Jacob"
lastName = " Qumsiyeh"
fullName = firstName + lastName
length = len(fullName)
print(fullName) # Output: Jacob Qumsiyeh
print(length) # Output: 14 Because of the space between them
